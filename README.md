The program is run, by running the Main.java file. The code was written in vscode and the csci3060ugroupproject folder is open
in the code editor, so the current directory is the csci3060ugroupproject folder and the program will be able to find the .txt files. 
The program will ask for the user to type "login". Once they do, it will ask for their username. 
When a correct username is given, the program will ask for a command will accept the required commands and a help command
that lists the various commands.
